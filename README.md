This repository is made for the exam of the summer school in social data science in Copenhagen. In this project we will the affect of the construction and opening of metro station on housing prices.

## Motivation
---
Although improvements in public transport infrastructure such as newly opened metro stations increase the mobility of citizens, it could also negatively affect the living conditions of people living in proximity of the newly constructed stations and stops due to noise pollution. In this project we will establish how and to what extent the construction and opening of new metro lines do to neighbouring real estate properties. In other words, *what will be the effect of the opening and construction of new metro stations be on the value of houses in the surrounding area?*. To make an argument for that, we will investigate a comparable situation; the effect of the construction of the metro lines M1 and M2 on the housing market in Copenhagen which were constructed between 1996 and 2002 [Copenhagen Metro](https://intl.m.dk/about-the-metro/facts/history/?fbclid=IwAR1u8RDPC4tKfQnEGhUQaDKGxCNfdnMRAJDDmpZ3JAwDION0ML_c5WvXyfc).
